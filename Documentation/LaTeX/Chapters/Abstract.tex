\chapter*{Abstract}

In this group project, we made ourselves acquainted with the subject of quantum dots (QD) and QD solar cells as an application thereof. \\

We used OMEN, a simulation tool for nanoelectronic devices, to simulate lead sulfide (PbS) QDs and created a MATLAB toolbox which
simplifies the simulation as well as the administration and visualisation of simulation data significantly.\\

We then simulated the eigenenergies and eigenstates of PbS QDs for different parameters and analyzed the data. In particular, dependencies on the QD's size and on the electric field were investigated. In the case of band gaps, we compared the results with experimental absorption data.\\

During the project, we also had the possibility to observe nanocrystal synthesis in the laboratory.
